# Portfolio
This project was possible with my collegues who were in Computer Science Foundation Programme at University of Southampton using Python.
The purpose of this project is to create an educational application model for students to get hang of the topic "Hooke's Law" in Physics class. 

These are all the necessary files in order to run the fully functional application powered by tkinter library. 

Code Files
main_window.py - Main menu to access all the learning experiences

Theory.py - Window for learning theoretical asepcts of the Hooke's Law

main_parallel.py 
main_seperate.py } - 3 types of virtual experience windows for students to try out 3 different types of experiments (Parallel, seperate and series).
main_series.py

Credit part.py - Credits of the team members

The single image file (Hooke.jpg) was downloaded from google for main menu window design.
