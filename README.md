# Portfolio
This project was possible with my collegues who were in Computer Science Foundation Programme at University of Southampton using Python.
The purpose of this project is to create an educational application model for students to get hang of the topic "Hooke's Law" in Physics class. 

These are all the necessary files in order to run the fully functional application powered by tkinter library.
